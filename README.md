# ADA helpers
Helper functions for applied data analysis.

## Structure

* The folder `helpers` contains the main scripts. To import them, copy this folder to the root of your project. In your code, you can them import them using `from helpers.<...> import *`, where `<...>` should be the name of one of the `.py` files of the `helpers` folder. For example, `from helpers.dataframes import *`.
* The `test_datasets` simply contains some datasets that are used in the tests and demonstrations of this repository.
* The `test_<...>.ipynb` files are Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of the functions of this repository.
